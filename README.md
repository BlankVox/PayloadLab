# PayloadLab ðŸ§ª

**An interactive collection of web exploitation payloads â€” with live, self-hostable examples and educational writeups.**

PayloadLab is built for infosec learners, CTF players, bug bounty hunters, and web devs who want to understand the *why* behind common web vulnerabilities like:

-  XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)
-  SQLi (SQL Injection)
-  SSTI (Server-Side Template Injection)
-  RCE (Remote Code Execution)
-  LFI (Local File Inclusion)

## Features

- Live demos of vulnerable endpoints
- Curated payloads with explanations
- Writeups for how each vuln works
- Docker support for local sandboxing

>  **For educational use only. Always hack ethically.**
